This project shows a simple example of firewall rules and secure network design. It supports my Palo Alto Networks Cybersecurity certification by demonstrating:

- How to write clear rule sets
- How to visualize secure network layouts
- Practical understanding of ports, subnets, and access control

## 🔐 Files Included

- `firewall_rules.txt` – Example of basic firewall rules
